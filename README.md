This is a HTML CSS project on recreating google using forms. This project is an assignment project from Harvard's CS50X Web Development with Python and Javascript.
It consists of three HTML pages:
1)index.html: The google search page which opens the google search results for any query entered in the textbox. It comes with the I'm Feeling Lucky button which mimics the functionality 
              of google's I'm feeling lucky button.
2)image.html: It is the google images page which opens the images for a particular query entered in the textbox
3)advanced.html: It is the google advanced page which allows advanced search just like google.
